HOW TO RUN:Step 1) Run the Server.	Once started it will enter an infinite loop, in which is possible to enter various 	commands. Type “shutdown” to terminate the Server.Step 2) while having the Server running on a terminal window, open a second terminal to      help visualise the results of the commands on the separate window.	Commands:	- create_database.sh requires an argument specified after it					ex. ./create_database.sh folder_name- create_table.sh requires 3 arguments specified, the folder name, the table name and the columns names.					ex. ./create_table folder name table_name col1,col2,col3- insert_data.sh requires 3 arguments, the folder name, the table name and the values of the tuple to insert there has to be a corresponding amount of columns in the file 			ex. ./insert_data.sh folder name table name val1,val2.val3- query.sh if user enters 2 arguments it prints the corresponding table. If user inputs 3 arguments it checks if the number in the 3rd argument corresponds to a column number and displays it.			ex. ./query.sh folder_name table_name 2,3Step 3) to request info from the server, the query will be entered from the client side. It will be then computed by the server in background, to return the desired answer.type "exit" to exit the client(s)]+_+[Project by: Francesco Ensoli
